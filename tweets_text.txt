@jooycesv tem como esquecer ??????
@ghosthecklers gotcha. "true", but it was forecast initially to be a hurricane (albeit cat 1). weaker but much larger than a supercell.
well i wish i could take that offer..,
@ghosthecklers it was worthy of media attention thu-fri. if anyone was hyping it as apocalyptic hellstorm, though, that was always dumb.
